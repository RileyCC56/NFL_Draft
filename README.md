## Resources

The following data was collected from the Stat Head webpage. The first goal was to web scrape the page but as the desired results were filtered through many different columns the web scraping URL was only collecting the first 100 results. Leading to me manually copying the results into a CSV where I was then able to read the data into a Jupyter Notebook to begin the analysis.
